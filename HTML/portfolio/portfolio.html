                    Hi, my name is Andrew Yang! I am a Computer Engineering graduate from Milwaukee School of
                    Engineering. My
                    education has provided me with extensive hands-on project experience in both software and embedded
                    systems,
                    allowing me to hone my skills in Java, C++, Python, VHDL, and more. I am proficient in utilizing
                    software tools
                    such as Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ, VS Code, Git, and others.
                    <br><br>
                    From the Revature Pre-Employment Program, I gained practical experience in implementing real-world
                    solutions
                    using modern technologies like the Spring Framework, Maven, Javalin, and SQL. This program
                    emphasized the
                    importance of testing tools such as JUnit and Mockito, ensuring each software module functions as
                    intended. It
                    has instilled in me a strong commitment to learning and applying high-quality solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    I am passionate about continuous learning and growth, as demonstrated by my academic achievements
                    and successful
                    code evaluations during the Revature program. I am eager to further expand my knowledge and would be
                    grateful
                    for the opportunity to showcase and apply what I have learned in a professional setting.
